  # Our GitHub repository defines a branch protection rule that requires a job called `Integration Test` to pass before
  # a PR can be merged. If no application-relevant files were changed in the PR (as detected by the `paths-filter` job),
  # this dummy job is executed instead of the actual integration test. Since this job is also named "Integration Test",
  # the required status check is still satisfied. This way, the branch protection rule can be kept, and the following
  # is ensured:
  # - non-application-relevant PRs are not blocked from being merged,
  # - the CI/CD tests of non-application relevant PRs execute and finish almost instantly, and
  # - application-relevant PRs are blocked from being merged until the actual end-to-end integration test passes.
